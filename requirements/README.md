# Pinned dependencies

This directory contains some 'pinned' dependencies used in testing.
Users are **not** required to use these pinned versions of cellmlmanip's dependencies.

They are generated using Python 3.6, and are not expected to work with all other versions.

To update, install `pip-tools`, and run `make`.
